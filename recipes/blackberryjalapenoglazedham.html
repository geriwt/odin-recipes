<body><h1>Blackberry Jalapeno Glazed Ham </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 fresh jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>12 ounces frozen blackberries</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup orange-flavored liqueur</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
        <li>1 (12 pound) spiral-sliced, fully-cooked smoked ham</li>
</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high. Place jalapeno peppers on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until skin on the jalapenos is blackened and bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove jalapeno peppers from oven and place in a resealable plastic bag; set aside for 5 to 10 minutes. Carefully open the bag and remove jalapeno peppers; let sit until easily handled. Peel blackened skin from jalapeno peppers, slice open, remove the seeds, and mince the pepper.</li>
            <li>Combine jalapeno peppers, blackberries, water, brown sugar, honey, orange juice, orange-flavored liqueur, garlic, and orange zest in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until glaze has reduced in size and is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes more. Mash the glaze with a potato masher until blackberries are broken down. Remove saucepan from heat</li>
            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place the ham in a roasting pan and brush some of the glaze over the ham; cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with glaze every 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 3 hours. Remove ham from oven and brush with more glaze. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
